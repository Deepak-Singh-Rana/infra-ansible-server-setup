#go to a redhat 8 server
dnf install python3-policycoreutils setools-console selinux-policy-devel



1. copy the three files to the redhat server
2. cp splunk.if /usr/share/selinux/devel/include/services/
3. make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile DISTRO=rhel7
4: copy the .pp file back to this server so it can be included in an ansible deployment
